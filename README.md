## Lab 10 - EncryptedMessageApp
 
## Scenario 
You have been hired to build a simple console/terminal based program and will continue to expand on and add to your code over the next three weeks. For the first week you will read in messages from a file and search through an ArrayList storing those messages by subject, "to" line, and "from" line. Instructions can be found in the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab10EncryptedMessageApp/package-summary.html).

Here is an examples of the program running:

```text
Welcome to Wonderland Messenger.
[S]: search for a message
[X]: exit
What would you like to do? s
What type of search would you like to do?
Options are: subject, to, from subject
Enter your search phrase:  meeting
Found message!
TO: Cheshire Cat
FROM: Quick Rabbit
SUBJECT: Important Meeting
BODY: Don't be late for our very important date!

Welcome to Wonderland Messenger.
[S]: search for a message
[X]: exit
What would you like to do? x

Process finished with exit code 0
```

## Step 1: Self-Explanation
Take a look at the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab10EncryptedMessageApp/package-summary.html) and take note of the methods you need to create/implement. See what code has been provided and what still needs to be done. Brainstorm some ideas on how to implement these methods, and write your thoughts down.

## Step 2: Implementation
Follow the [javadoc](https://csu-compsci-cs163-4.github.io/Lab10EncryptedMessageApp/package-summary.html) and write some code. Make sure to write tests for your code as you work on each method.

## Step 3: Finishing up
To turn in your assignment, click through the link on
Canvas, upload your files to Zybooks and click submit for grading. Note you can do 
this more than once.
